# Bonsai

__Koch ideas__
* Be able to standardize plots easily
  * Set colorscheme
  * Line/point style
  * Add error bars
  * Resize
  * Set axis values
  * Double y-axes
  * Highlight certain data points or lines
* Manipulate data
  * Be able to import new data and handle it accordingly
  * Change which data is being used (i.e., plot X vs Y, or X vs Z)
  * Tell which data goes to which axis
    * Multi-axis plots
    * Error bars
  * Filter data
    * Have move stringent filters (i.e., if max in some set, only use that set)
  * Envelope over data (this is kind of getting into postprocessing than solely plotting)
